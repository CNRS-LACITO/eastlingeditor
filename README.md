This is the official repository of EASTling - Easy Annotation and Synchronization Tool for linguists.
A demo is available [here](https://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/test/pangloss/tools/eastling/demo/#/demo). A poster (in French) is available [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01873903/document). 

A major overhaul of EASTling is planned in 2020-2021.

This tool is developed by [Matthew Deo](https://github.com/m8nli9ht) in collaboration with the team of [the Pangloss Collection, an archive of endangered languages](https://pangloss.cnrs.fr/).
